# 🎭 EmojiVerse - Because Words Are So 2010 🎭

> **Warning:** This project may cause excessive emoji usage in your daily communication. Side effects include: becoming the "emoji person" in your friend group, replacing entire sentences with pictographs, and an uncontrollable urge to 👍 everything.

## 🤔 What Even Is This?

Remember when you spent 47 minutes scrolling through your phone's emoji keyboard looking for that ONE perfect emoji? Yeah, we got tired of that too. So we built an entire universe dedicated to those tiny yellow faces and random objects.

EmojiVerse is like a dating app, but for emojis. Swipe right on your favorites, create collections, and finally find out what 🗿 actually means (spoiler: it's a moai statue, you're welcome).

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Go "Wait, I Need This"

- **🔍 Smart Search** - Type "happy" and get 47 variations of smiling faces. Type "sad" and question your life choices.
- **📋 One-Click Copy** - Click once, paste everywhere. It's like Ctrl+C had a baby with convenience.
- **💾 Custom Collections** - Hoard emojis like a digital dragon. Name them things like "Passive Aggressive Work Emails" or "When Bae Texts Back."
- **📚 Emoji Encyclopedia** - Learn what each emoji ACTUALLY means (spoiler: you've been using 🍆 wrong this whole time... or have you? 😏)
- **🌙 Dark Mode** - Because your eyes deserve better at 3 AM when you're crafting the perfect emoji response.
- **🎨 Browse by Category** - Animals, food, faces, and that weird section with random objects nobody asked for.
